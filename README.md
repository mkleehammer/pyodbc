pyodbc is an open source Python module that makes accessing ODBC databases simple.  It
implements the [DB API 2.0](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249) specification but is
packed with even more Pythonic convenience.

The easiest way to install is to use pip:

    pip install pyodbc

Precompiled binary wheels are provided for most Python versions on Windows and macOS.  On other
operating systems this will build from source.  Note, pyodbc contains C++ extensions so you will
need a suitable C++ compiler on your computer to install pyodbc, for all operating systems.  See
the [docs](https://github.com/mkleehammer/pyodbc/wiki/Install) for details.
